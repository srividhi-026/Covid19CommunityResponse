    <div class="container">

        <p>
            In the course of your associated work with the group, you may have access to, see or hear,
            confidential information concerning personal affairs of Clients or Volunteers.
        </p>

        <p>
            Unless acting on the instructions of an authorised person within the group, on no account
            should such information be divulged or discussed except in the performance of your normal
            duties. This is a requirement of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) effective
            25/05/2018.
        </p>

        <p>
            You must ensure that all records, including computer screens and computer printouts of
            any Clients or Volunteers, are never left in such a manner that unauthorised persons can
            obtain access to them. All client information should be held on a password protected device,
            with the password known only to those accessing client information in the performance of
            their duties.
        </p>

        <p>
            Computer screens must always be cleared when left unattended and you must ensure you log out
            of computer systems.
        </p>

        <p>
            Confidential or sensitive information relating to an individual may be divulged where
            there is a risk of danger to the individual, a volunteer, or the public at large, or
            where it is against the law to withhold it. In these circumstances, information may be
            divulged to external agencies e.g. police or social services on a need to know basis.
