    <h5>Why and how do we ensure compliance?</h5>

    <p>
        Data protection provides rights to individuals with regard to the use of their Personal Data by organisations, including our organisation. Irish and EU laws on
        data protection govern all activities we engage in with regard to our collection, storage, handling, disclosure and other uses of Personal Data.
    </p>

    <p>
        Compliance with the data protection rules is a legal obligation. In addition, our compliance with the data protection rules helps individuals to have confidence
        in dealing with us and helps us to maintain a positive reputation in relation to how we handle personal information.
    </p>

    <p>
        The data protection rules that apply to us are currently contained in the Data Protection Act 1988 Revised, the Data Protection Act 2018, in the ePrivacy 
        Regulations 2011, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (EU Regulation 679/2016) (the “GDPR”) and in related legislation (together the “DPAs”).
    </p>
