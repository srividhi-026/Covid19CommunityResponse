        <h5>Introduction</h5>

        <p>
            Covid Community Response hereinafter referred to as ‘the Organisation’ needs to gather and use certain
            information about individuals. Covid Community Response is made up of local volunteers to support
            vulnerable people during the Coronavirus outbreak. The service is set up to help the residents of
            Ireland with tasks such as shopping, transport, befriending, and basic support during isolation caused
            by the virus. This policy describes how this personal data must be collected, handled and stored to meet
            the organisation’s data protection and privacy standards — and to comply with the law. The Organisation
            is established in the Republic of Ireland therefore this document is written in the vein of Irish Data
            Protection Law, as the Organisation falls under the jurisdiction of the Irish Data Protection Commission.
        </p>


        <h5>Why this policy exists</h5>

        <p>
            This policy ensures the Organisation:
        </p>

        <ul>

            </li>
            <li>
                Is open about how it stores and processes individuals’ data
            </li>
            <li>
                Protects itself from the risks of a data breach
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Data protection and privacy law</h5>

        <p>
            The Organisation must comply with the data protection and privacy principles set out in the relevant data protection
            and privacy law
        </p>

        <p>
            These laws describe how organisations must collect, handle and store personal information. These rules
            apply regardless of whether data is stored electronically, on paper or on other materials. To comply
            with the law, personal information must be collected and used fairly, stored safely and not disclosed
            unlawfully.
        </p>

        <p>
            Not all representatives of the Organisation will be expected to be experts in data protection and privacy
            law. However, the Organisation is committed to ensuring that its representatives have sufficient awareness of the
            law in order to be able to anticipate and identify a data protection or privacy issue, should one arise.
            In such circumstances, representatives must ensure that the DPCO is informed, and in order that
            appropriate corrective action is taken.
        </p>

        <p>
            The General Data Protection Regulation is underpinned by eight important principles which are
            explained in detail herein. These say that personal data must:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>-&nbsp; Be processed fairly and lawfully</li>
            <li>-&nbsp; Be obtained only for specific, lawful purposes</li>
            <li>-&nbsp; Be adequate, relevant and not excessive</li>
            <li>-&nbsp; Be accurate and kept up to date</li>
            <li>-&nbsp; Not be held for any longer than necessary</li>
            <li>-&nbsp; Processed in accordance with the rights of data subjects</li>
            <li>-&nbsp; Be protected in appropriate ways</li>
            <li>-&nbsp; Not be transferred outside the EU, unless that country or territory also ensures an adequate level of protection</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>The Organisation as a Data Controller</h5>

        <p>
            An organisation responsible for deciding how Personal Data is held and used is called a ‘data controller’.
            The Organisation processes Personal Data as a data controller according the principles and rules captured
            herein.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to the above, the Organisation exchanges Personal Data with Service Providers on the
            Data Subjects’ behalf in order to fulfil services to Data Subjects. This is performed consistently with
            the obligations of the Organisation under the terms of contracts with Service Providers.
            Service Providers may be Third Parties or Data. Where required by law, a formal, written contract is in
            place with the Service Provider, outlining their obligations in relation to the Personal Data, the
            specific purpose or purposes for which they are engaged, and the understanding that they will process
            the data in compliance with data protection and privacy law.
        </p>
        <p>
            This Policy provides the guidelines for this exchange of information, as well as the procedure to follow
            in the event that a representative of the Organisation is unsure whether such data can be disclosed. In
            general terms, the representative should consult with the DPCO to seek clarification.
        </p>

        <h5>People, Risks and Responsibilities</h5>

        <h6><b>Policy scope</b></h6>

        <p>
            This Policy applies to all Personal Data collected, processed and stored by the Organisation in relation
            to its
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>-&nbsp; directors,</li>
            <li>-&nbsp; employees,</li>
            <li>-&nbsp; contractors,</li>
            <li>-&nbsp; representatives,</li>
            <li>-&nbsp; associates,</li>
            <li>-&nbsp; service providers,</li>
            <li>-&nbsp; service users</li>
            <li>-&nbsp; people who have accessed, used or subscribed to Information Services of the Organisation,
                including web platforms and other applications,
            </li>
            <li>-&nbsp; end users of services, or</li>
            <li>-&nbsp; the general public, or other data subjects and other connections as applicable,
                in the course of its activities.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This policy applies to:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>-&nbsp; The general operations of the Organisation</li>
            <li>-&nbsp; All staff of the Organisation,</li>
            <li>-&nbsp; All contractors, suppliers and other people working on behalf of the Organisation,</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This Policy applies to all data that the company holds relating to living individuals, even if that
            information technically falls outside of the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679. This can
            include:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>-&nbsp; Names of individuals</li>
            <li>-&nbsp; Postal addresses</li>
            <li>-&nbsp; Email addresses</li>
            <li>-&nbsp; Telephone numbers</li>
            <li>-&nbsp; ...plus any other information relating directly or indirectly to individual</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This Policy covers both personal and special category Personal Data held in relation to data subjects by
            the Organisation. This Policy applies equally to Personal Data held in manual and automated form. All
            Personal and Special Category Data will be treated with appropriate care by the Organisation. Both
            categories will be equally referred-to as personal data or data in this Policy, unless specifically
            stated otherwise.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Organisation is committed not only to the letter of the law, but also to the spirit of the law and
            places high importance on the correct, lawful and fair handling of all Personal Data, respecting the
            legal rights, privacy and trust of all individuals with whom it deals.
        </p>

        <h5>Data protection risks</h5>

        <p>
            This policy helps to protect the Organisation from some very real data security risks, including:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>-&nbsp; <b>Breaches of confidentiality.</b> For instance, information being given out inappropriately.</li>
            <li>-&nbsp; <b>Failing to offer choice.</b> For instance, all individuals should be free to choose how
                the company uses data relating to them.</li>
            <li>-&nbsp; <b>Reputational damage.</b> For instance, the company could suffer if hackers successfully
                gained access to sensitive data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Data Protection Co-Ordinator (DPCO)</h5>

        <p><i>General</i></p>

        <p>
            As part of the requirements laid down in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), it is not
            mandatory for the Organisation to have a formally appointed DPO, however the role of Data Protection
            Co-Ordinator will be fulfilled by Andrea Manning of Data Influence. This role facilitates compliance
            and ensures that in carrying out its “core activities” – the primary services provided by the
            Organisation - all private individuals’ data held and processed by the Organisation, such as internal
            representatives, the Organisation service users, and third parties, is appropriately protected in line
            with their regulatory rights.
        </p>

        <p>
            The contact details of the DPCO will be published to all data subjects (internal and external) and the
            generic privacy address will be provided. The name of the DPCO does not need to be publicly published.
        </p>

        <p>
            The DPCO will be attend to any matters involving data protection at the earliest possible
            stage, including privacy impact assessments, data processing activities that may affect data
            subjects and incidents which effect the data of subjects. This may involve the DPCO
            engaging external professional support. Where it is decided not to follow the expert
            advice from a Data Protection specialist, the matter of discussion, the discussion, the
            professional recommendation, and the reasons for not adhering to the recommendation should be
            formally recorded.
        </p>

        <p>
            The DPCO has been and will continue to be educated and upskilled in order to ensure best
            practice within their role as DPCO.
        </p>

        <p><i>Responsibilities of the DPCO</i></p>

        <p>The DPCO must monitor the ongoing data processing and storage of Personal Data by the Organisation via:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                -&nbsp; collection of information to identify processing activities
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        -&nbsp; If required to do so by law, the DPCO must maintain the “record of processing
                        operations”, a document required by the GDPR which details all the Personal Data processing
                        activities of the Organisation</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                -&nbsp; analysis and checking the compliance of processing activities with GDPR, the Data
                Protection Acts, and internal policies
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        -&nbsp; This will be accomplished via technical controls, reviews, assessments, and audits.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p><i>Data Protection Impact Assessments</i></p>

        <p>
            It is the task of the Organisation to carry out Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) as necessary.
            If the decision is made to outsource DPIA’s the DPCO provides advice and guidance at each stage of the
            DPIA as follows:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>-&nbsp; whether or not to carry out a DPIA</li>
            <li>-&nbsp; what methodology to follow when carrying out a DPIA</li>
            <li>-&nbsp; whether to carry out the DPIA in-house or whether to outsource it</li>
            <li>-&nbsp; what safeguards (including technical and organisational measures) to apply to
                mitigate any risks to the rights and interests of the data subjects</li>
            <li>-&nbsp; whether or not the data protection impact assessment has been correctly carried out
                and whether its conclusions (whether to go ahead with the processing and what
                safeguards to apply) are in compliance with the GDPR
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Responsibilities</h5>

        <p>
            Everyone who works for or with the Organisation has some responsibility for ensuring data is collected,
            stored and handled appropriately.
        </p>

        <p>
            Everyone who handles personal data must ensure that it is handled and processed in line with
            this policy and data protection and privacy principles. This includes contractors and sub-contractors.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, these people have key areas of responsibility:

            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp;- Employees should request help from their line manager or the data protection
                co-ordinator if they are unsure about any aspect of data protection or privacy
            </li>

        </ul>

        <h5>Data Management Rules</h5>

        <h6>Data storage</h6>

        <p>
            These rules describe how and where data should be safely stored. Questions about storing
            data safely can be directed to the Development Team or data controller.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                &nbsp;- When data is stored on paper, it should be kept in a secure place where unauthorised
                people cannot see it.
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp;-These guidelines also apply to data that is usually stored electronically but has been
                printed out for some reason:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        &nbsp;- When not required, the paper or files should be kept in a locked drawer or filing
                        cabinet.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        &nbsp;- Employees should make sure paper and printouts are not left where unauthorised
                        people could see them, like on a printer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        &nbsp;- Data printouts should be shredded and disposed of securely when no longer required.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

        </ul>

        <p>
            When data is stored electronically, it must be protected from unauthorised access, accidental deletion
            and malicious hacking attempts:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Data should be protected by strong passwords that are changed regularly and never shared between
                    employees
                </li>
                <li>
                    If data is stored on removable media (like a CD or DVD), these should be kept locked
                    away securely when not being used.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Data should only be stored on designated drives and servers and should only be
                    uploaded to an approved cloud computing services.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Servers containing personal data should be sited in a secure location, away from
                    general office space.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Data should be backed up frequently. Those backups should be tested regularly, in
                    line with the company’s standard backup procedures.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Data should never be saved directly to laptops or other mobile devices like tablets or
                    smart phones.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All servers and computers containing data should be protected by
                    approved security software and a firewall.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h5>Data use</h5>

        <p>
            Personal data is of no value to the Organisation unless the business can make use of it.
            However, it is when personal data is accessed and used that it can be at the greatest risk of
            loss, corruption or theft:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                &nbsp; - When working with personal data, employees should ensure the screens of their computers are
                always locked when left unattended.
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp; - Personal data should not be shared informally.
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp; - Personal data should never be transferred outside of the European Economic Area.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Data accuracy</h5>

        <p>
            The law requires the Organisation to take reasonable steps to ensure data is kept accurate
            and up to date.
        </p>
        <p>
            The more important it is that the personal data is accurate, the greater the effort the Organisation
            should put into ensuring its accuracy.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is the responsibility of all employees who work with data to take reasonable steps to ensure
            it is kept as accurate and up to date as possible.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                &nbsp;- Data will be held in as few places as necessary. Staff and contractors should not create any
                unnecessary additional data sets.
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp;- the Organisation will make it easy for data subjects to update the information the
                Organisation holds about them. For instance, via the company website.
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp;- Data should be updated as inaccuracies are discovered. For instance, if a user can no longer
                be reached on their stored telephone number, it should be removed from the database.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>The Data Protection Principles Explained</h5>

        <p>
            This Policy aims to ensure compliance with the data protection and privacy law, particularly the GDPR.
            The GDPR sets out the following principles with which any party handling Personal Data must comply.
            Article 5 in the GDPR states that all Personal Data must be:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                &nbsp; - Processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject;
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp; - Collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in
                a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the
                public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall not be considered
                to be incompatible with the initial purposes subject to appropriate safeguards, and provided that
                there is no risk of breaching the privacy of the data subject.
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp; - Adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which
                it is processed;
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp; - Accurate and where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken
                to ensure that Personal Data that is inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for
                which they are processed is erased or rectified without delay;
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp; - Kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is
                necessary for the purposes for which the Personal Data is processed; Personal Data
                may be stored for longer periods insofar as the Personal Data will be processed solely
                for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes
                or statistical purposes subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and
                organisational measures required by the GDPR in order to safeguard the rights and
                freedoms of the data subject;
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp; - Processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the Personal Data, including
                protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction
                or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures;
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp; - Article 5(2) states that the Controller is responsible for and must be able to demonstrate
                compliance with the Data Protection Principles.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h6><i>Lawful, Fair and Transparent Data Processing</i></h6>

        <p>
            The GDPR seeks to ensure that Personal Data is processed lawfully, fairly and transparently, without
            adversely affecting the rights of the data subject. The GDPR states that processing of Personal Data
            shall be lawful if at least one of the following applies:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                &nbsp; -  Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the
                controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the fundamental rights
                and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of Personal Data, in particular where the
                data subject is a child;
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp; - Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject
                is a party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering
                into a contract;
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp; - Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller
                is subject;
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp; - The data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her Personal Data for
                one or more specific purposes;
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp; - Processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or
                of another natural person;
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp; - Processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest
                or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.
            </li>
            <li>
                    &nbsp; -
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The Organisation will ensure that at least one of the conditions outlined above will be satisfied whenever
            any processing activities take place.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to obtain Personal Data fairly and in a transparent manner, the Organisation will make the data
            subject aware of the following at the time the data is collected directly:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                &nbsp; - Identity of the Data Controller and the DPCO
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp; - Purpose and legal basis for processing. An explanation of the legitimate interest of the
                Organisation will be provided if it is being used as the legal basis.
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp; - Data subject’s rights to withdraw consent, request access, rectification or restriction
                of processing.
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp; - Data subject’s rights to complain to the relevant supervisory authority
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp; - Recipients of the Personal Data.
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp; - Storage periods or criteria used to determine the length of storage.
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp; - Legal basis for intended international transfer of data to a third country or organisation,
                including the fact that either the receiving country has an adequacy decision from the relevant
                supervisory authority or other appropriate safeguards are in place and how to obtain a copy.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            In situations where the data is not being collected directly from the data subject, the Organisation
            will provide the source along with the other information listed above to the data subject within a
            reasonable period after obtaining the data but not more than one month. Information will not be provided
            to the data subject if it will require disproportionate effort or it would render it impossible or
            seriously impair the purpose of the data processing.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Data Subjects’ Personal Data will not be disclosed to a third party other than to a party
            contracted to the Organisation and operating on its behalf.
        </p>

        <h6><i>Processed for Specified, Explicit and Legitimate Purposes</i></h6>

        <p>
            The Organisation follows this purpose limitation principle and only collects and processes Personal Data
            for the specific purposes set out in the “Record of Processing Activities” document held by the Organisation,
            where required. The purposes for which the Organisation processes Personal Data will be informed to data
            subjects at the time their Personal Data is collected or not more than a month if obtained from a third party.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Organisation will not further process Personal Data in a manner that is incompatible
            with those purposes unless:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                &nbsp; - the consent of the data subject has been obtained, or
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp; - if the further processing is for archiving purposes in the public interest or scientific
                and historical research or statistical purposes and the appropriate safeguards are in
                place and there is no risk of breaching the privacy of the data subject.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h6></i>Adequate, Relevant and Limited Data Processing</i></h6>

        <p>
            The Organisation follows this data minimisation principle and only collect and process
            Personal Data for and to the extent necessary for the specific purpose(s) informed to data
            subjects.
        </p>

        <h6></i>Accuracy of Data and Keeping Data Up to Date</i></h6>

        <p>
            The Organisation will ensure that all Personal Data collected and processed is kept accurate
            and up-to-date. The accuracy of data will be checked when it is collected. Where any inaccurate or
            out-of-date data is found, all reasonable steps will be taken without delay to amend or erase that
            data, as appropriate.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Amend inaccurate data which has been notified to the Organisation by the Data
                Subject or is revealed as a result of a subject access request.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h6><i>Timely Processing</i></h6>

        <p>
            The Organisation follows this storage limitation principle and does not keep Personal Data
            for any longer than is necessary in light of the purposes for which that data was originally
            collected and processed.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Organisation will verify whether statutory data retention periods exist in relation to the
            type of processing e.g., Personal Data may need to be kept in order to comply with tax, health and safety,
            or employment regulations etc. If the law is silent, internal data retention periods will be set to meet the
            storage limitation principle.
        </p>
        <p>
            Retention periods will be set considering the purpose or purpose for which the data is collected and
            used, and once the storage periods expire, data will be securely deleted/destroyed in the absence of a
            sound new lawful basis to retain it. However, Personal Data may be stored for longer periods by the
            Organisation insofar as the Personal Data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public
            interest, scientific, historical research or statistical purposes ensuring appropriate safeguards are
            in place i.e.irreversibly anonymised.
        </p>

        <p>The Organisation keeps record of this in the “Record of Processing Activities” document.</p>

        <h6><i>Secure Processing</i></h6>

        <p>
            The Organisation will ensure that all Personal Data collected and processed is kept secure
            and protected against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss,
            destruction or damage. The state of technological development, the cost of implementing
            the measures, the nature of the data concerned and the degree of harm that might result
            from unauthorised or unlawful processing are all considered when the Organisation are
            determining the security measures that are put in place
        </p>

        <h6><i>Accountability</i></h6>

        <p>
            Under the GDPR, organisations are obliged to demonstrate that their processing activities
            are compliant with the Data Protection Principles. The principle of accountability seeks to
            guarantee the enforcement of the Principles.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Organisation will demonstrate compliance in the following ways:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                &nbsp; - If required by law, by keeping an internal record of all Personal Data collected, held or
                processed as per Article 30 - “Records of Processing Activities”. Upon request, these records will
                be disclosed to the relevant supervisory authority. The Organisation is required to keep certain
                records of processing activity
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        &nbsp; - When the Organisation is acting as a Data Controller this record will contain the
                        following:
                        <ul>
                            <li>

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - List of Personal Data being processed
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Categories of data subjects
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Processing activities

                    <li>
                        &nbsp; - When the Organisation is acting as a Data Processor this record will contain the
                        following:

            </li>

            <li>
                &nbsp; - In order to assess the potential risks arising out of any new processing activity the
                GDPR requires organisations to conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment(DPIA). The Organisation
                will demonstrate its compliance by carrying out Assessments whenever any new processing activity is
                proposed, especially where it involves new technologies, resulting in a high degree of risk for
                data subjects. After the DPIA has been carried out and if all the risks cannot be mitigated, then
                the Organisation will consult with the relevant supervisory authority. The DPIA will be overseen by
                the DPCO of the Organisation and the DPIAs will be filed and retained as proof of compliance.
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp; - The Organisation will appoint a Data Protection Officer in place of the DPCO if required
                i.e. if its core data processing activities involve:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale; or
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Processing special category Personal Data on a large scale.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                The Organisation maintains a data protection and privacy document framework i.e.policies & procedures,
                training records etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Organisation ensures that data protection by design is addressed throughout the life cycle of
                any processing activity but especially at the time of planning the means and type of processing
                and during the processing itself. Necessary safeguards are integrated into the systems of the
                Organisation with the use of data minimisation and pseudonymisation as privacy enhancing tools.
                The Organisation assess the risks of a process and tries to mitigate those risks in order to meet
                the data protection by design requirements.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Organisation also ensures that data protection by default is implemented by choosing the most
                data protective setting as the default i.e. users will have to opt in to any settings that presents
                greater risks. By default, only the Personal Data that is necessary is processed.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Special Category Data</h5>

        <p>

        <h5>Data Subject Rights and Access Requests</h5>

        <p>
            The Organisation has a separate and detailed procedure for handing data subject rights requests. As part
            of the day-to-day operation of the Organisation, the representatives of the Organisation engage in
            active and regular exchanges of information with Data Subjects. Where a formal request is submitted by a
            Data Subject in relation to the data held by the Organisation, such a request gives rise to access rights
            in favour of the Data Subject. Data Subjects can exercise their rights by contacting the DPCO utilising
            the contact details listed herein. The Organisation will always verify the identity of anyone making a
            subject access request before handing over any information
        </p>

        <p>
            Where a formal request is submitted by a Data Subject in relation to the data held by the Organisation,
            such a request gives rise to access rights in favour of the Data Subject, the GDPR sets out the following
            rights applicable to data subjects:

            Data Subject, depending on the nature and extent of the request. The representatives of the Organisation
            will ensure that, where necessary, such requests are forwarded to the DPCO in a timely manner, and they
            are processed as quickly and efficiently as possible.
        </p>

        <h5>Disclosing data for other reason</h5>

        <p>
            In certain circumstances, the General Data Protection Regulation allows personal data to be
            disclosed to law enforcement agencies without the consent of the data subject. Under these circumstances,
            the Organisation will disclose requested data. However, the data controller will ensure the request is
            legitimate, seeking assistance from the board and from the company’s legal advisers where necessary
        </p>


        <h5>Data Protection Notices, or as known in practice, Privacy Notices</h5>

        <p>
            The Organisation adheres to the following requirements related to data protection and privacy notices and
            the provision thereof.
        </p>

        <h5>When is a data protection notice required?</h5>

        <ul>
            <li>
                &nbsp; - Where information is being collected directly from an individual, a Data Protection Notice
                must be provided at the point at which the data is collected.
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp; - Where information is obtained from another source, a Data Protection Notice must be provided:

            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp; - If disclosure to another recipient is envisaged, at the latest when Personal Data are
                first disclosed.
            </li>
        </ul>

            </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Marketing and Mailing Lists</h5>

        <p>
            &nbsp; - The Electronic Privacy Regulations 2011 (SI 336 of 2011) sit alongside the Data Protection Acts.
            They give people specific privacy rights in relation to electronic communications and contain specific
            rules on:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                &nbsp; - Marketing calls, emails, texts and faxes
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp; - Cookies (and similar technologies)
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp; - Keeping communications services secure; and
            </li>
            <li>
                &nbsp; - Customer privacy regarding traffic and location data, itemised billing, line
                identification, and directory listings.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            While primarily aimed at electronic communications companies (telecommunications companies and internet
            services providers), the Electronic Privacy Regulations also apply to any entity using such
            communications and electronic communications networks to communicate with customers, e.g. by telephone,
            via a website or over email, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
            Unsolicited direct marketing is one of the main sources of complaints from individuals to
            the Data Protection Commission and anyone who fails to comply with the E-Privacy Regulations can be
            prosecuted as each unlawful marketing message or call constitutes a separate offence.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is imperative that the necessary marketing opt-ins and opt-outs (via a data protection notice
            or privacy notice or otherwise) are in place before using Personal Data for marketing purposes
        </p>

        <h5>Transferring Personal Data to a Country Outside the EEA </h5>
